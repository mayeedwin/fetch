# Javascript Fetch API Demo

The [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) provides an easy, logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network.

## Your Project

### ⛱ README.md

That's this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

### ⛱ index.html

Where I have written the content of our JavaScript App.

### ⛱ App.css

CSS files add styling rules to your content.

### ⛱ App.js

Our `module` import main script. The data is rendered from this file too. 

### ⛱ ``./modules/``

We have our Fetch module here, `Fetch.js`

### ⛱ ``./data/``

Directory with our users profiles, in `Users.json`. Feel free to add more data into it.

### ⛱ assets

Drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project
